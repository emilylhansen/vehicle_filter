## Task

Your task will be to create Web GUI that will show these vehicles with their status and the customers who own them.

## Analysis

This application has a tab that allows admins to easily view and filter their customers' vehicles. The design is clean and sleek to showcase the vehicles and their affluent owners, and pops of color provide a modern feel. The grid makes it easy to identify vehicles, their status, and several other important details at first glance. The sidebar provides filter and search making it easier to discover vehicles that fit certain criteria.
